# This is the source code for my website
alexblass.me

This website hosts my portfolio. It is also a proof-of-concept for my coursework in 15-319 Cloud Computing. The site is hosted on a GKE cluster and managed by Helm. I use Github Actions in order to continuously integrate and deploy this site. Since this is a proof of concept, I use a self-signed TLS certificate. 

TODO: using cert-manager and LetsEncrypt, provision a valid TLS certificate
